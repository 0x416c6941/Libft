# Libft
The first library and very first project in 42.
<br>
As of *17th of September, 2024*, the code present here passes
**everything, including Moulinette** with bonus on 100%.
<br>
<br>
Please note, that this is not the original version of *"Libft"* project,
but the one extended with extra functions, such as:
* ft\_lstswap
* ft\_lstat
* ft\_printf

**ft\_printf** and **get\_next\_line** are integrated here as well.
